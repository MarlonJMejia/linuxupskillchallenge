<p>A month-long course aimed at those who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in industry - junior Linux sysadmin, devops-related work and similar. Server focussed and commandline, but assumes essentially no prior knowledge, and starts off very gently - designed to be well-suited to a Windows or Apple person as well as those that already
using Linux in some form.</p>

<p>The course is run via Reddit, so you will need a Reddit login, and to subscribe to: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge">r/linuxupskillchallenge</a>

<p>Each weekday a new lesson is posted there, and it allows a great forum-style interface to discuss and get help.</p>

<p>This was a $250 paid course, but is now free and fully open source - so costs you nothing but your time!</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The focus is on practical skills</li>
  <li>Heavily hands-on</li>
  <li>Requires a daily commitment of 1-2 hours each day for a month</li>
  <li>Often points to curated external links.</li>
  <li>Much less ‘formal’ than RHEL or Linux Foundation training</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re keen to do this, then you will need your own Internet-exposed server - but full
instructions on how to set this up for free or cheap are now up as ‘Day 0’ posts in the
subreddit.</p>

<p>The next course starts on Monday 06 March. As each new lesson gets posted, we’ll be trimming an earlier one - so make sure you keep up!</p>

<p>Each month we’ll ‘reset’, with “Day 1” again going up on the first Monday of the month.</p>
